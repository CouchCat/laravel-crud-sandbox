Notes: Sandbox02 Laravel

This project is aimed to copy and remake the PHP exercises from "/T08AmpStack/" Chapter 15 - 19
but using Laravel 5.3 as the framework. Additionally, Gulp, Sass, Git and Laravel's Blade and
Eloquent ORM is also be used.

Workflow:

- conceptualize and create the database table(s) with phpMyAdmin (then make migration Schema)
- create simple layout and html/css prototypes

Setting up the environment:
- Make sure you have Node.js version 6 or higher
    node -v
- (if not already) Install Composer https://getcomposer.org/download/ and check if correctly installed:
    composer
- Create a new directory in the preferred directory using the CLI:
    composer create-project laravel/laravel <folder_name>
- Navigate to the created folder and download npm dependencies with
    composer install
- download Gulp with:
    npm install --global gulp
- Install all other npm dependencies as well as Laravel Elixir with
    npm install
- Check if Laravel Server can be run:
    php artisan serve
- open localhost:8000 in the browser
- (Setup up Elixir (follow guide above) for sass and multiple javascript files, etc...)
- Run MySQL and Apache
- Run Gulp (preferably "gulp watch") on a second CLI so you can run "php artisan serve" on the other

Tips:

- Setting up Gulp.js with Laravel's Elixir https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/elixir#working-with-scripts
- For CRUDing: https://scotch.io/tutorials/simple-laravel-crud-with-resource-controllers
- Shortcut for Resource-Controller:
    php artisan make:controller <controller_name> --resource
- For Bootstrap Glyphicons create folder at "/public/fonts/bootstrap" and add this to the Gulp file:
    mix.copy('node_modules/bootstrap-sass/assets/fonts/bootstrap/','public/fonts/bootstrap');
- When working with Sessions, Redirects, etc.. add this on top of the Controller
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Validator;
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Input;
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redirect;
    use Session;
- When working on Laravel Blade Forms, "Illuminate/Html" is deprecated so install "Collective/Html"
    Follow this site: https://laravelcollective.com/docs/5.2/html

Resource - Controller actions:

    Verb 	      Path 	         Action 	   Route Name
    GET 	      /my 	         index 	     my.index
    GET  	      /my/create 	   create      my.create
    POST 	      /my 	         store 	     my.store
    GET 	      /my/{my} 	     show      	 my.show
    GET 	      /my/{my}/edit  edit 	     my.edit
    PUT/PATCH 	/my/{my} 	     update      my.update
    DELETE 	    /my/{my}       destroy 	   my.destroy

Authentication:

- Following this guide: https://auth0.com/blog/creating-your-first-laravel-app-and-adding-authentication/
- Configures and creates auth files automatically:
    php artisan make:auth
- This creates a bunch of files: "views/auth", adds code to "web.php" and in the controller, etc
- Migrate the migration data that were already precreated in "database/migrations"
    php artisan migrate
- Configure the "LoginController.php" and the "RegisterController.php" files on the "$redirectTo" variable
-Configure the views: "views/auth", "home.blade.php" and "welcome.blade.php"
